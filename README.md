HELLO WORLD


# Myfirstproject


To get started, simply type the command 'bundle install' to install the program. This project uses httparty so if you don't have that you will need to install it as well. Orginally when this project was started, I used nokogiri and open-uri to scrape from the websites I needed the information from. Uforntunately, due to timing, and complexity, I had to pivot and used httparty instead.

Once installed, to run the program you will type  'bin/my-first-project'.

The program will help animal lovers in Ventura County find shelters in the area based on a species choice. (Cat or Dog)
Once the user selects which specices they will be presented with a choice of animal shelters numbered 1 - 20.
After the user makes a choice, they will be shown the address & phone nummber  of the animal shelter they selected.
